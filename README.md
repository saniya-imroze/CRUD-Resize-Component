# CRUD Resize Component

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application built with React.js for the front end and Express.js for the back end. It provides resizable components on the front end and handles data operations via RESTful APIs on the back end. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- Resizable Components: The front end includes resizable components using react-resizable and react-resizable-panels libraries, providing a flexible and customizable user interface.
- API Operations: The back end provides RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations on data stored in MongoDB. It supports POST and PUT requests for creating and updating data.
- Data Binding: The application utilizes data binding to display changes simultaneously, ensuring a seamless user experience.
